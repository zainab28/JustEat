How to run JusteatFirst10.py:
  - python JusteatFirst10.py [postcode]
  - e.g. python JusteatFirst10.py EC4M7RF
  - If python is not installed, go to https://www.anaconda.com/download
  - click download
  - run the installer Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Windows-x86_64
  - Go to the destination .e.g. cd C:\Users\[name]\anaconda3

Improvements that could be made would be:
  - To sort by ratings where the top restuarants are returned to the user
  - To sort by proximity to the user's postcode
  - Return a list of restuarants by the cuisine the user enters
