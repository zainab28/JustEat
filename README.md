JustEat Assessment Day

How to run JusteatFirst10.py:
  - python JusteatFirst10.py <postcode>
  - e.g. python JusteatFirst10.py EC4M7RF

Improvements that could be made would be:
  - To sort by ratings where the top restuarants are returned to the user
  - To sort by proximity to the user's postcode
  - Return a list of restuarants by the cuisine the user enters
